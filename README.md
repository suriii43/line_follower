## Chapter 1: Introduction  

- **Line-following robots**: Autonomous machines that navigate along a predefined path, typically a black line on a white surface.  
- **Arduino Uno**: Acts as the "brain," processing sensor input and controlling motors.  
- **IR Sensors**: Detect the line and provide essential feedback for navigation.  
- **Servo Motor**: Ensures the robot stays aligned with the line by adjusting its direction.  
- **DC Motors**: Drive the robot along the line.  
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Controls the speed and direction of DC motors based on Arduino signals.  
- **Battery**: Powers all components, ensuring consistent functionality.  
- **Breadboard**: Simplifies prototyping by providing easy connection points for components.
